Hello! This is Sumanth Sadu, a Graduate Student at University of Southern California pursing Computer Science. I believe that every movement in universe is planned and organised, which always leads me to be motivated for future steps which I take. I also believe, learning to be evergoing process and fundamental principle of life. My interests lies in the field of Machine Learning (NLP, CV), Software Development, Data Science, and Research, which are currently shaping the world for a better society. These advancements are bridging the gap between seemingly unrelated domains like Physics, Communication, Arts and even Sociology!. I am very much excited to do my part of contribution for healthier civilization.
